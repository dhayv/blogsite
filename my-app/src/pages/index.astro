      <p class="text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        I'm a Cloud & DevOps Architect who builds scalable, secure infrastructure
        using AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, and automation pipelines. But this blog
        isn't a resume—it's a blueprint.
      </p>
      <p class="text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        Everything here is deployed with <strong>Terraform</strong>, served through
        AWS <strong>S3, CloudFront, Route 53, and ACM</strong>, and automated via
        <strong>GitHub Actions</strong>—all stitched together in
        <strong>Astro</strong>. It's not just hosted in the cloud; it's built to
        reflect how I solve real-world problems.
      </p>
      <p class="text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        I write to document strategy, not just story. You'll find battle-tested
        solutions, breakdowns of infrastructure choices, and patterns that turn
        complexity into clarity. Whether you're building your stack or scaling your
        team, these are the insights I wish someone shared with me earlier.
