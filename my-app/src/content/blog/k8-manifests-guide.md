When working with Kubernetes, you will have to use manifests to configure your workloads. I wrote this guide to help break down the two most basic k8s YAML files that you'll need. Kubernetes manifests serve as instruction manuals that define resources like Pods, Services, and Deployments, written in YAML format.

> Tip: YAML is strict with indentation—use an online validator to avoid syntax errors.

## Key Kubernetes Resource Types: Deployments and Services

Two common manifests in a Kubernetes cluster are:

1. **Deployment:** Manages Pods and ensures high availability.
2. **Service:** Exposes applications and manages networking.


## Kubernetes YAML Manifest Structure Explained

There are 3 parts to a Kubernetes configuration:

1. **Metadata:** Where you define the name and labels for your resource
2. **Spec (Specification):** The actual configuration of what you want, specific to each resource type
3. **Status:** Automatically generated by Kubernetes to reflect the current state of the resource.

### Kubernetes Metadata: Names and Labels

Metadata includes essential information about the resource, such as its name and labels. Labels are key-value pairs that help categorize and select Kubernetes resources. They enable flexible organization, such as grouping resources by environment (e.g., env: production), tier (e.g., tier: backend), or other custom criteria.

```yaml
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment  # Name of the Deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx           # Labels to identify the application
```

### Kubernetes Spec: Defining Desired State for Pods

The spec section defines the desired state of the resource. For example, in a Deployment, the spec includes the number of replicas, the selector for matching Pods, and the template for Pod configuration.

```yaml
spec:
  replicas: 2              # Number of pod replicas for high availability
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx           # Must match the labels in the template
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx         # Labels applied to the pods
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx         # Name of the container
        image: nginx:1.14.2 # Replace with the URL of your container image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80 # Port the container listens on
```

### Kubernetes Status and Self-Healing Explained

The status section is automatically generated by Kubernetes. It reflects the current state of the resource, such as the number of available replicas in a Deployment. Kubernetes continuously monitors the **actual state** against the **desired state** and takes action to reconcile any differences, leveraging its self-healing capabilities.

For example, in our deployment manifest we specified we wanted 2 replicas:

```yaml
spec:
  replicas: 2
```

When the deployment is created, Kubernetes will continuously check the status to make sure we have 2 replicas running at all times. If only 1 replica(**actual state**) is running, it's not at the **desired state**.

## Full Kubernetes Deployment and Service YAML Examples

Deployment:

A Deployment manages a set of identical Pods, ensuring that the specified number of replicas are running at all times. This ensures high availability and load distribution across your application.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment # Create a deployment resource
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment # Name of the Deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx # Labels to identify the application
spec:
  replicas: 2 # Number of pod replicas for high availability
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx # Must match the labels in the template
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx # Labels applied to the pods
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx # Name of the container
        image: nginx:1.14.2 # Replace with the URL of your container image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80 # Port the container listens on
```

Service:

A Service exposes your application to the network, managing how traffic is directed to the Pods. By setting the Service type to LoadBalancer, Kubernetes provisions an external load balancer (if supported by your cloud provider) to route traffic to your Service, allowing users to access your application via a public IP address.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service # Create a service resource
metadata:
  name: nginx-service # Name of the service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer # Exposes the service via a cloud provider's load balancer
  selector:
    app: nginx # Links this service to Pods with the label app: fastapi
  ports:
    - port: 80 # Exposed port for external traffic
      targetPort: 80 # Port on the container to route traffic to
      protocol: TCP # Communication protocol
```

### Kubernetes apiVersion and kind: Declaring Resource Types

The first two line in a Kubernetes yaml manifest is where you declare to Kubernetes the resource type you want to create:

**Service**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service # Create a service resource
```

**Deployment**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment # Create a deployment resource
```

## How Kubernetes Services Connect to Deployments

Service and deployments are connected through **selectors** and **labels**. This connection ensures that traffic directed to the Service is properly routed to the appropriate Pods managed by the Deployment.

In the deployment file:

```yaml
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment 
  labels:
    app: nginx # Labels to identify the application
```

```yaml
spec:
  replicas: 2 
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx # Must match the labels in the template
```

```yaml
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx # Labels applied to the pods
```

**Service File**

```yaml  
labels:
    app: nginx # Labels to identify the application
```

### How Kubernetes Labels, Selectors, and Traffic Routing Work

1. **Labels:** In the Deployment file, the **metadata.labels** and **template.metadata.labels** sections assign the label **app: nginx** to the Deployment and its Pods. Labels are key-value pairs that help categorize and select Kubernetes resources.
2. **Selectors:** In the Deployment's **spec.selector.matchLabels** and the Service's **spec.selector**, the label **app: nginx** is used to match and connect the Service to the appropriate Pods.
3. **Traffic Routing:** The Service uses the selector to identify which Pods to send traffic to. When external traffic arrives at the Service's **port**, it is forwarded to the **targetPort** on the matched Pods.

### Kubernetes Service Port vs targetPort vs containerPort

```yaml
  ports:
    - port: 80 # Exposed port for external traffic
      targetPort: 80 # Port on the container to route traffic to
      protocol: TCP # Communication protocol
```
Think of it this way:

1. External traffic comes to the Service on 'port'
2. The Service forwards that traffic to 'targetPort' on your pods
3. Your container needs to be listening on 'targetPort'

These ports must align properly:

- The Service's "targetPort" must match the "containerPort" in your Deployment
- The Service's "port" can be different, but is commonly set to the same number for simplicity

## Deep Dive: Kubernetes Manifest Components

### Using Labels to Organize Kubernetes Resources

Metadata provides essential information about your Kubernetes resources. Proper labeling is crucial for organizing and managing resources efficiently. Labels allow you to group resources based on various criteria, such as environment (env: production), application tier (tier: backend), or custom categories (app: nginx).

### Kubernetes Deployment Spec: Replicas, Selectors, and Templates

The spec section is the core of your manifest, defining the desired state of the resource. For Deployments, key spec fields include:

- **Replicas:** Specifies the number of Pod instances to run. For example, replicas: 2 ensures that two Pods are always running, providing high availability.

```yaml
replicas: 2
```

- **Selector:** Determines how the Deployment identifies which Pods to manage. It must match the labels defined in the Pod template.

```yaml
selector:
  matchLabels:
    app: nginx
```
- **Template:** Defines the Pod's metadata and specifications, including labels, containers, and ports.

```yaml
template:
  metadata:
    labels:
      app: nginx
  spec:
    containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:1.14.2
      ports:
      - containerPort: 80
```

### How Kubernetes Self-Healing Maintains Desired State
The status section is managed by Kubernetes and provides real-time information about the resource's current state. It helps Kubernetes track whether the actual state matches the desired state defined in the spec. If discrepancies are detected, Kubernetes takes corrective actions, such as restarting Pods to maintain the desired number of replicas.

#### Example of Self-Healing:

If a Pod crashes or becomes unhealthy, Kubernetes will detect that the actual number of running Pods does not match the desired replicas specified in the Deployment. It will then automatically create a new Pod to replace the failed one, ensuring that the application remains available.

### How Kubernetes Manifests Work Together

Now that we've broken down each component of Kubernetes manifests, you can see how they work together to create a robust and self-healing application infrastructure. The combination of proper metadata, well-defined specs, and Kubernetes' built-in status monitoring ensures your applications run reliably and efficiently.
