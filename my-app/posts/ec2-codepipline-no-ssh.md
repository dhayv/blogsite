Technologies Used:

1. **GitHub:** Stores the application’s source code.
2. **AWS CodePipeline:** Detects changes in the repository, triggers builds, and initiates deployments.
3. **AWS CodeBuild:** Builds your code into production-ready artifacts.
4. **AWS CodeDeploy:** Automates the deployment of your builds onto EC2 instances.
5. **Amazon EC2:** Hosts your web application.
6. **Amazon S3 (Optional):** Stores build artifacts
7. **IAM:** Manages secure permissions for the pipeline and services to interact.

## Business Value

### Key Benefits

- **Improved Reliability:** No more manual SSH deployments. CodeDeploy ensures consistency in every deployment.
- **Faster Iteration:** Push code and let the pipeline test and deploy automatically, speeding up feedback loops.
- **Rollback Capability:** If something goes wrong, CodeDeploy can roll back to a previous stable version quickly, minimizing downtime.

### Problem Statement

Your team currently deploys updates by SSHing into a live EC2 instance—leading to human error, missed steps, and risky rollbacks. This tutorial fixes that by detecting GitHub changes automatically, deploying them via CodeDeploy, and using a repeatable, testable process.

### Problem Solved

Traditional SSH-based deployments lead to:

- Human errors during manual deployments
- Inconsistent deployment steps
- Difficult rollbacks
- Security vulnerabilities

This solution implements industry best practices for automated, secure, and reliable deployments.

Ready to eliminate manual deployments? Let's build your pipeline.

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: GitHub Repository

You can use your own repo or follow along with mine:

Fork this repository:

Github Repo: [Github EC2](https://github.com/dhayv/ec2-deploy)

Repo Contains:

```bash

Repository Structure:
├── my-react-app/        # Sample React application
├── buildspec.yml        # CodeBuild instructions
├── appspec.yml         # CodeDeploy configuration
└── scripts/           # Deployment scripts
```

### Step 2: IAM Roles

> **Important:** If you attach a new role to an existing EC2 instance, reboot the instance so it recognizes the updated permissions.

#### EC2 Role

In the AWS Console search **Roles** -> **Create role**.

**Trusted Entity:** EC2 > EC2 use case.

![trusted-entity](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fx3h3xk6epg4ed7drlsd.png)

Click **Next**

**Add Permissions:** Attach the AmazonEC2RoleforAWSCodeDeploy policy.

Click **Next**

Provide a name for the role.

- EC2CodeDeployRole

Review your settings then click "Create role".

#### CodeDeploy Role

Click **Create role**.

**Trusted Entity:** EC2 > EC2 use case.

Click **Next**

**Add Permissions:** Attach AWSCodeDeployRole.

Click **Next**

Provide a name for the role.

- CodeDeployRole

Review your settings then click "Create role".

Edit the trusted policy using:

Search for the newly created **CodeDeployRole** and select.

Choose the **Trust relationships** tab.

Choose **Edit trust policy**.

Copy and paste this trust policy.

```bash
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": [
                    "codedeploy.amazonaws.com"
                ]
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
```

Click "Update policy".

### Step 3: EC2 Configuration

In the AWS console search up **EC2** > **Launch Instance.**

#### Launch an Instance

Keep default settings.

![base-image](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o55sqrhlyq14w0prvhuc.png)

**Name and tags:** Name your instance.
**Application and OS Images:** Ubuntu
**Instance type:** t2.micro
**Key pair (login)**: Create or use an existing key pair.

![network-settings](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5wgb0ny4fg49nqpdr8kq.png)

**Network settings:** Use or create a security group allowing SSH (port 22) from your IP and HTTP (port 80) from the internet..

Under **Advanced details**

**IAM instance profile:** EC2CodeDeployRole

User data: Install the CodeDeploy agent on launch. Adjust region endpoints if you’re not using us-east-1:

Use this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/resource-kit.html#resource-kit-bucket-names) to get your region to fetch your appropriate code-deploy region identifier

Edit this line in the script  "aws-codedeploy-us-east-1.s3.us-east-1." with your appropriate region and identifier.

![User data](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9sexqsp88zsl7x67fzyy.png)

Copy and paste the code below.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update system
apt update -y

# Install CodeDeploy Agent
apt install ruby-full -y
cd /home/ubuntu
wget https://aws-codedeploy-us-east-1.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/latest/install
chmod +x ./install
./install auto

systemctl enable codedeploy-agent
systemctl start codedeploy-agent
```

Click **Launch Instance** and wait until it’s initialized..

#### Instance Role

We will be attaching an IAM role to an instance to allow CodeDeploy to pull/put artifact onto the instance.

### Step 4: CodeDeploy Setup

We are setting up CodeDeploy first because it makes it easier to use and reference for later in the CodePipeline Section.

In the AWS search and select **CodeDeploy** > **Create Application**.

![deployment-name](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9aqmo5pntewaahtha0z9.png)

- **Application name:** vite-react-deploy
- **Compute platform** EC2/on-premise

Click **Create application**.

![deployment-group](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/013gqzipin0nliruzevn.png)

Click **Create deployment group**

#### Create deployment group

![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7tr2q3qqmwan6610vcew.png)

Deployment group name: vite-react-group
Service role: CodeDeployRole (Select the service role we created earlier)

Deployment type: In-place

![Environment-config](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/poxr1brkq403klei85r1.png)

Select "Amazon Instances".
Key: Name
Value: Select your Instance

Leave the default settings for Agent configuration with AWS Systems Manager and Deployment settings.

##### Load balancer

**Enable load balancing:** Uncheck selection

Click **Create deployment group**

Review changes than Click **Create deployment**

> Now on the creating a deployment page we can leave this section empty(exit page) and just move on to the next section because CodePipeline will handle the deployment for.

#### AppSpec Basics

```yaml
version: 0.0
os: linux
files:
  - source: /my-react-app/dist
    destination: /var/www/html/
hooks:
  BeforeInstall:
    - location: scripts/before_install.sh
      timeout: 300
      runas: root
  AfterInstall:
    - location: scripts/after_install.sh
      timeout: 300
      runas: root
  ApplicationStart:
    - location: scripts/start_application.sh
      timeout: 300
      runas: root
```

##### AppSpec Configuration Explained

- `source: /my-react-app/dist` is where CodeBuild places the compiled files.
- `destination: /var/www/html/` is where Nginx serves static files.
- `hooks:` are scripts you define to run before/after install and on app start.

### Step 5 CodePipeline Integration

In the AWS console search **CodePipeline** > **Create Pipeline**

![pipeline-step1](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8l6q2php3r18btk9cf0a.png)

This option allows us to build a custom pipeline to deploy from GitHub.

Click **Next**.

![pipeline-settings](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9d5u7991pld2d7kmbeff.png)

- **Name the Pipeline:** Choose a meaningful name.
- **Service Role:** Select New service role to allow AWS to create a role automatically.

![pipeline-step2.2](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/exnw2d023p8ppo614088.png)

- **Advanced settings:** Use the default location to allow AWS to create an S3 bucket for CodePipeline artifacts, which will maintain deployment history.

#### Source

![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yjvh8uarv6zwwg2chmh2.png)

I have previously connected to GitHub so I will be using that connection.

**For New Connections:**

Click **Connect to GitHub**.

![github-app-connection](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xjs59qnrzck9wu4esa8h.png)

Name your connection and click **Connect to Github**.

![aws-connector](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0wejg7zcchncuj8uqaj4.png)

Click **Authorize AWS Connector for Github** to grant AWS access to your GitHub repository.

![basic-connect](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1q4k4u5qkt8kmz1tfwyh.png)

- A basic GitHub user connection suffices for our deployment pipeline.
- If working with multiple organizations, select the specific user or organization repositories you want to use.
- Click **Connect**.

#### Configure Source Stage

- **Source Provider:** GitHub (via GitHub App)
- **Connection:** Your GitHub connection
- **Repository Name:** Select your repository
- **Default Branch:** main
- **Output Artifact Format:** Default settings
- **Webhook Events:** Trigger the pipeline on push and pull request events.
- Click **Next**.

#### Build Stage

Here is where we will be the vite app using the buildspec.yml. so we will be creating a CodeBuild project to reference our file in the repo.

Click **Create project**

![buildstage](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7lrc3x5puwh93c3ofpbf.png)
![build-stage2](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7p3jwt85d90h73x0kxzq.png)

Keep the default settings.

Name your project.

A new service role will be create for us through AWS.

##### Buildspec

![build-spec](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i0wvrr9cxat0o0xbtt8u.png)

**Build specifications:** Use a buildspec file

Here is where your buildspec.yml in the repo will be referenced.

```yaml
version: 0.2

phases:
  install:
    runtime-versions:
      nodejs: 20
    commands:
        - cd ./my-react-app
        - npm install
       
  build:
    commands:
        - npm run build
     
artifacts:
  files:
    - 'my-react-app/dist/**/*'
    - 'appspec.yml'
    - 'scripts/**/*'
  discard-paths: no
```

(This builds your Vite app and includes the dist, appspec.yml, and scripts folder in the output artifacts.)

###### BuildSpec Configuration Explained

- `cd ./my-react-app` will move to the react app folder
- `npm install` will install all our node dependencies
- `npm build` will build our production static vite app into the dist folder
- The `'./my-react-app/dist'` line is to ensure all files in the build output are copied.
- `'**/*'` will include all build files in the root folder
- The `appspec.yml` and `scripts/**/*` are explicitly listed to ensure they're included

![codebuild-logs](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t9oz7vyr7lf6fkqar5i9.png)

Click **Continue to CodePipeline**

**Build provider:** Other build providers (AWS CodeBuild)
**Build Type**: Single Type
**Region:** Select your Region
**Input artifacts:** Keep defaults

Click **Next**

#### Deploy Stage

Here is how we will deploy to our EC2 instance. We will be using the CodeDeploy application we created earlier.

![deploy-build](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6mxpao11uxy8g4paevyl.png)

**Deploy provider:** CodeDeploy
**Region:** Select your region
**Input artifacts:** Keep defaults
**Application name:** vite-react-deploy
**Deployment group:** vite-react-group

Click **Next**

Review your settings than click "Create pipeline"

Your Pipeline will now run an each stage we worked on will get built.

Now head on over to your instance an get the public address our site should now be deployed on the EC2 Instance.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you’ve implemented a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using CodePipeline as the orchestrator an AWS Codebuild and CodeDeploy, EC2, and GitHub. This setup transforms your deployment process from fragile and manual to consistent, secure, and fast. You’ve minimized human error, introduced a clear rollback mechanism, and set the stage for more advanced enhancements—like adding integration tests, canary deployments, or blue/green strategies.

This is a crucial step toward embracing modern DevOps practices and ensures any team can deliver value to users with speed and confidence.
